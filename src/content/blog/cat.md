Found numbers in a friends attic: 58695 27498 21201 78951 63521

Next to radio equipment and cryptography books.

One-time pad. Unbreakable without the key.

These numbers could mean anything - HELLO or ABORT or your grocery list. Shannon proved it: perfect secrecy.

The key is gone. So the message exists in superposition, simultaneously containing every possible meaning.

I'm calling it Schrodingers Ciphertext.

That's not a bug. That's the feature. This is fiction.
